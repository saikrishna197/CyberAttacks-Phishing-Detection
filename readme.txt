What is Phishing?
Phishing attacks are the practice of sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source.
The goal is to steal sensitive data like credit card and login information, or to install malware on the victim’s machine.
It is a common type of cyber attack that everyone should learn about in order to protect themselves. 

How does phishing work?
Phishing starts with a fraudulent email or other communication that is designed to lure a victim. 
The message is made to look as though it comes from a trusted sender.
If it fools the victim, he or she is coaxed into providing confidential information, often on a scam website.
Sometimes malware is also downloaded onto the target’s computer.

What are the dangers of phishing attacks?
Sometimes attackers are satisfied with getting a victim’s credit card information or other personal data for financial gain.
Other times, phishing emails are sent to obtain employee login information or other details for use in an advanced attack against a specific company.
Cybercrime attacks such as advanced persistent threats (APTs) and ransomware often start with phishing.
